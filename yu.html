<p>Made in China, that's s what we heard, but it is true, or is it???.
    China is a country that is made up of good and bad people, every country has it's own problem, 
but they were hacking that was from China, but the U.S & china were not always in good 
the term, because china is a communist government, but they were a lot of important 
and confidential information was taken, from America, and around the world.    </p>


<br>

<h2>Why are people afraid of china!????</h2>
<hr>
<img src="yr.jpg" height="200"></img>
<p> The reason government is not 100 % happy with china, is because they don't want communism to spread to their country, so they may import good form china, but they are level of barrier that is set, to protect from communism regime and other
    stuff, that is not good for a government. manufacturing left u.s, some time ago, but to
    manufacture to China, you have to give them tech, which they use, and they became good at it. so the lesson in this, is that we need to think and support our choice
    made daily and think before acting in a decision. </p>
<br>
<h2>The understand of the problem!</h2> 
<hr>
<p>China is a country that has its problem, the things that worry American is that,
    china will get ahead of them, in both economical and industrialization, or development.
    the government of China is doing what it can, to make its military strength, so it is doing 
    what it can, to modernize it's military, and expand if it can. 
</p>
<br> 
<p> What we must do to avoid global conflicts, is to help each other, find ways 
    approach problems, that is both modernize and environmental issue, which will be deal 
    with swiftly and proficiently. 
</p>
<ol> <li>China is a big country since ancient time</li>
<li> China has the second gdp, behind the u.s around the world.</li>
<li> china is going to have the highest gdp, if the u.s does nothing</li>
</ol>

<h2> What lesson did i learn while reading the book??</h2>
<hr> 
<br>
<p> The lesson that I learn in these books, is that we should
    not be bringing our weapon to another country unless it is justified, and necessary, and we 
    should help our community, country, if we can, and if we make a change, it will
    benefit the lives of many people, that's why we must first learn, explored, tackle the problem that we faced, 
    and try finding a good solution, for the benefit of all. 
</p>
<p> As the books stated, the people really holds the power in creating american jobs.
