<p> In these books, they explain big & small corporations moving out of America, 
    because it was easy, cheaper, and more labor workforces, with less pay. the reason was because
    of the government regulation on businesses, and a lot of big/small company did not like that,
    so they move to Mexico, or Canada, because of some trading deal made with those three countries.

<p>  When a manufacturing company moves out of America, it affects millions upon millions of
    Americans and this even impact the GDP of the country, and it is not good. small town and big town get affected when millions
    of Americans lost their jobs, and fewer workers mean slow working city/town, and less tax means fewer revenues, and it is not good, because
    it impacted on the lives of other people, and the GDP.

<h2> Why did it happen! </h2> <hr>
<p> Some people may say it was because the company wanted to fatten their 
    wallets', it was true, but it was mainly because of government interference and regulation, 
    that made them look for other countries, for manufacturing. manufacturing in America
    is a big deal, because thanks to manufacturing they won the war against japan,
    during world war 2, japan tough he could have won, but the discovery of atomic bomb made America superior, 
    so the Japanese surrender.

</p>

<p> And he said, what happens when those companies left what are the consequence effect after
    that. Roedel said each year, manufacturing company close, and move elsewhere, which laid millions of 
    Americans workers. Manufacturing where leaving, and it was leaving a big impact on America, and he said if we support our manufacturing
    company, it could help a lot. he said that we choose to create demand for foreign or domestic manufacturing cars and trucks.
    But now he said that the majority of products they now sell are manufactured abroad.

<h2>  Not in america??
</h2> <hr>

<p>  Roedel said that U.S company are not interested, nor they
    moving forward with plans to build new manufacturing facilities in America. 
    so, the government finds ways to do a win-win with the population and company, with commitment and rule that help big/small companies. he said that, why does manufacturing company grow in us, and when they
    become a big company they left. he said: how could we bee the biggest exporter when we import more of what we exported.

<footer><p>   The big company left to do business abroad because it is cheaper, 
    easy, and there is less government regulation unlike the united states, the big company did not like to pay 
    tax, and so they try their best to do what they can, to not pay high taxes because of the government.
    Some companies got reform, but some failed. he said the last 200 years pioneers to the modern innovator, a small business that has not only built but driving the American economy.
